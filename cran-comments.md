## Release summary
- Several existing functions have been renamed for consistency.
- Multiple new functions added, expanding the package’s functionality.
- Introduced Quarto vignettes to demonstrate usage and workflows.
- Added a hex sticker for the package.


* One example (ppi_samplesize_effect) takes >10s to run.
  This is expected, as the function demonstrates sample size
  effects and requires a larger computation. Other examples
  run quickly.
